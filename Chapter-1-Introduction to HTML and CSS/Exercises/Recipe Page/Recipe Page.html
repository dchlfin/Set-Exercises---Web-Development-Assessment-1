					<li>In a small saucepan, cook chopped brown onion with olive oil on medium heat until soft. 
					<br>Add the dried oregano and garlic. 
					<br>Cook for 30 seconds, then turn off the heat and set aside to cool down.</li>
					<br>
					
					<li>In a mixing bowl, add the combined minced meats, salt and pepper, bread crumbs, cooked onion and garlic mixture, 
					<br>half the grated pecorino cheese, chopped parsley and one whole egg. 
					<br>Mix well using your hands.</li>
					<br>
					
					<li>Add olive oil to your hands, pick up a portion of the mixture and form into balls by using the palm of both your hands. 
					<br>Aim for 58 grams each or approx. 2 ounces. Use a scale for consistency, you should get close to 12-14 smeatballs.  
					<br>Roll them in flour.</li>
					<br>
					
					<li>Add a generous amount of olive oil to a frying pan on medium heat, enough to cover the bottom and a little more. 
					<br>Once the oil is hot, place half the meatballs and brown evenly by rolling them and basting them with the hot oil. 
					<br>They will be cooked enough in approx. 4 to 5 minutes. Once nice and brown, set them aside to rest on a warm plate. 
					<br>If pan is small, just cook half at a time.</li>
					<br>
					
					<li>Drain half the oil from pan and add the remaining half chopped onion, 1 clove of minced garlic, fry over medium heat.  
					<br>Add the passata (One bottle) rinse it out with a little water and pour into pan so there’s no wastage. 
					<br>Season with salt and pepper and add one bay leaf. Bring to a simmer. 
					<br>Return the meatballs to pan and cook for 30 minutes on low simmering heat.  
					<br>Make sure you turn them over every 6 minutes or so. If sauce is getting too thick, thin it out with pasta cooking water.</li>
					<br>
					
					<li>Meanwhile get your pasta water boiling, add salt. Once boiling, cook pasta 2 minutes less than al dente, 
					<br>as per instructions on packet.</li>
					<br>
					
					<li>Remove meat balls and place them on a hot plate in a warm spot.</li>
					<br>
					
					<li>Drain pasta and add directly to the sauce.  Finish cooking for two minutes in the sauce, turn off heat and 
					<br>add remaining grated Pecorino cheese. Mix well.</li>
					<br>
					
					
					<li>Serve Immediately.</li>
